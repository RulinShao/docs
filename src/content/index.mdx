# Welcome to Lit Canvas! 

Lit Canvas is a tool for researcher and LLM agents to collaborate to explore and discovery scientific literature. 
After the user provides some literature-based questions, Lit Canvas invokes LLM agents to call tools and search relevant papers. 
The user can follow up and provides feedback to refine the search.
In the end, the agent can learn from the feedback and improve the search trajectories for future queries.
